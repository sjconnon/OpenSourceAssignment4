### R statistical software ###
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment
which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies)
by John Chambers and colleagues.

## Website

https://www.r-project.org

## Why I chose this project:
R is a powerful open source tool for statistical computing and used extensively in the field of Ecology. 

## Project license
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc
It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems 
(including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.

## Reporting bugs
The developers walk users through a 5 step process of reporting bugs.
1. Making sure your problem is a bug.
2. Where to submit bug reports (a portal called "Bugzilla").
3. How to write useful and productive bug reports.
4. How to submit patches.
5. What to do if something goes wrong.

## Request new features
New features and bug fixes of the latest release version of R are documented
in the file NEWS (also contained in the R sources).
"R-announce" is an area of important announcements posted by the R Core Development team.

## Asking questions
Before asking for help on the internet, it is recommended to try to help myself. 
The 'help()' function and '?' help operator in R provides access to documentation
pages for R functions, data sets and other objects for packages in the standard
R distribution and contributed packages. 
For help online, I'm able to use internet search sites specialized for for R searches,
including search.r-project.org and Rseek.org.

## Contact developers
The R developers consists of a large team of individuals called the "R Core Team" who are
spread out throughout the world. The original R was initially written by Robert Gentleman 
and Ross Ihaka in 1997. Contact to developers isn't direct but there are forums and others
out there with the expertise to ask questions if needed. There is an R email list for 
answering questions about R. 
R-help for general help
R-devel for R code development
R-package-devel list for developers of CRAN packages. 

## Commercial support
After searching for help in all of the above mentioned places, there is also support
through a help and discussion site called Stack Overflow for all programming questions.

## Latest source code
Newest packages and announcements posted by the R-core team and package authors
https://www.r-project.org/news.html

## View code online
Within the program, the R Core Team provides about eight packages within the R distribution 
and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide 
range of modern statistics.

## Contributing
This link below shows how to import and export R data in R itself or via packages from CRAN
https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html
You can also use this page to write your own R extensions to create your own packages.

## Active?
Yes, very active all over the world. Looking at the archived messages on the R website, the lastest 
message was submitted August 31st, 2017 by the R Core Team.

## Other
It is amazing how expansive R is and how the utilization of the internet and open source 
has created a vast community developing upon itelf to utilize an integrated suite of 
software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.
